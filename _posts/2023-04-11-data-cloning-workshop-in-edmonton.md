I moved to Canada in 2008 to start a postdoctoral fellowship with Prof. Subhash Lele at the stats department of the University of Alberta. Subhash at the time just published a paper about a statistical technique called data cloning. Data cloning is a way to use Bayesian MCMC algorithms to do frequentist inference. Yes, you read that right.

I learnt about WinBUGS, OpenBUGS, then JAGS, and used data cloning for some projects. And I started abstracting away the workflow and in 2009 I submitted the [dclone](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dclone) package to CRAN. The dclone package is still alive and well, now even supports Stan.

Since then, Subhash has retired and I moved jobs. We thought recently that we should do another data cloning workshop like we did a few times over the years. And now it is coming up on April 13, 2023, as a joint meetup of the Edmonton and Calgary R User groups.

Mixed models, also known as hierarchical models and multilevel models, is a useful class of models for applied sciences. The goal of the workshop is to give an introduction to the logic, theory, and implementation of these models to solve practical problems. The workshop will include a seminar style overview and hands on exercises including common model classes and examples that participants can extend for their own needs.
