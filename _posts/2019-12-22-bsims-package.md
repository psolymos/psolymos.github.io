The [**bSims**](https://peter.solymos.org/bSims/index.html) R package is
a *highly scientific* and *utterly addictive* bird point count
simulator. Highly scientific, because it implements a spatially explicit
mechanistic simulation that is based on statistical models widely used
in bird point count analysis (i.e. removal models, distance sampling),
and utterly addictive because the implementation is designed to allow
rapid interactive exploration (via **shiny** apps) and efficient
simulation (supporting various parallel backends), thus elevating the
user experience.

The goals of the package are to:

1.  allow easy *testing of statistical assumptions* and explore effects
    of violating these assumptions,
2.  *aid survey design* by comparing different options,
3.  and most importantly, to *have fun* while doing it via an intuitive
    and interactive user interface.

The simulation interface was designed with the following principles in
mind:

1.  *isolation*: the spatial scale is small (local point count scale) so
    that we can treat individual landscapes as more or less homogeneous
    units (but see below how certain stratified designs and edge effects
    can be incorporated) and independent independent in space and time;
2.  *realism*: the implementation of biological mechanisms and
    observation processes are realistic, defaults are chosen to reflect
    common practice and assumptions;
3.  *efficiency*: implementation is computationally efficient utilizing
    parallel computing backends when available;
4.  *extensibility*: the package functionality is well documented and
    easily extensible.

This documents outlines the major functionality of the package. First we
describe the motivation for the simulation and the details of the
layers. Then we outline an interactive workflow to design simulation
studies and describe how to run efficient simulation experiments.
Finally we present some of the current limitations of the framework and
how to extend the existing functionality of the package to incorporate
more of the biological realism into the simulations.

## Simulation layers

Introductory stats books begin with the coin flip to introduce the
binomial distribution. In R we can easily simulate an outcome from such
a random variable \(Y \sim Binomial(1, p)\) doing something like this:

``` r
p <- 0.5

Y <- rbinom(1, size = 1, prob = p)
```

But a coin flip in reality is a lot more complicated: we might consider
the initial force, the height of the toss, the spin, and the weight of
the coin.

Bird behavior combined with the observation process presents a more
complicated system, that is often treated as a mixture of a count
distribution and a detection/nondetection process, e.g.:

``` r
D <- 2 # individuals / unit area
A <- 1 # area
p <- 0.8 # probability of availability given presence
q <- 0.5 # probability of detection given availability

N <- rpois(1, lambda = A * D)
Y <- rbinom(1, size = N, prob = p * q)
```

This looks not too complicated, corresponding to the true abundance
being a random variables \(N \sim Poisson(DA)\), while the observed
count being \(Y \sim Binomial(N, pq)\). This is the exact simulation
that we need when we want to make sure that an *estimator* is capable of
estimating the *model* parameters (`lambda` and `prob` here). But such
probabilistic simulations are not very useful when we are interested how
well the *model* captures important aspects of *reality*.

Going back to the Poisson–Binomial example, `N` would be a result of all
the factors influencing bird abundance, such as geographical location,
season, habitat suitability, number of conspecifics, competitors, or
predators. `Y` however would largely depend on how the birds behave
depending on timing, or how an observer might detect or miss the
different individuals, or count the same individual twice, etc.

Therefore the package has layers, that by default are *conditionally
independent* of each other. This design decision is meant to facilitate
the comparison of certain settings while keeping all the underlying
realizations identical, thus helping to pinpoint effects without the
extra variability introduced by all the other effects.

The conditionally independent *layers* of a **bSims** realization are
the following, with the corresponding function:

1.  landscape (`bsims_init`),
2.  population (`bsims_populate`),
3.  behavior with movement and vocalization events (`bsims_animate`),
4.  the physical side of the observation process (`bsims_detect`), and
5.  the human aspect of the observation process (`bsims_transcribe`).

This example is a sneak peek. Go to the package 
[website](https://peter.solymos.org/bSims/articles/intro.html) where the
vignette describes all the arguments.

## Statistical validity of the simulations

We can test the validity of the simulations when all of the assumptions
are met (that is the default) in the homogeneous habitat case. We set
singing rate (`phi`), detection distance (`tau`), and density (`Den`)
for the simulations. Density is in this case unrealistically high,
because we are not using replication only a single landscape. This will
help with the estimation.

``` r
phi <- 0.5 # singing rate
tau <- 2   # detection distance
Den <- 10  # density

set.seed(1)
l <- bsims_init()
a <- bsims_populate(l, density=Den)
b <- bsims_animate(a, vocal_rate=phi)
o <- bsims_detect(b, tau=tau)

tint <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
rint <- c(0.5, 1, 1.5, 2) # truncated at 200 m
(x <- bsims_transcribe(o, tint=tint, rint=rint))
## bSims transcript
##   1 km x 1 km
##   stratification: H
##   total abundance: 1014
##   duration: 10 min
##   detected: 259 heard
##   1st event detected by breaks:
##     [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 min]
##     [0, 50, 100, 150, 200 m]
(y <- get_table(x, "removal")) # binned new individuals
##          0-1min 1-2min 2-3min 3-4min 4-5min
## 0-50m         1      3      1      2      0
## 50-100m       7      3      5      1      1
## 100-150m     12      2      2      1      2
## 150-200m     13      8      2      1      1
colSums(y)
## 0-1min 1-2min 2-3min 3-4min 4-5min 
##     33     16     10      5      4
rowSums(y)
##    0-50m  50-100m 100-150m 150-200m 
##        7       17       19       25
```

We use the **detect** package to fit removal model and distance sampling
model to the simulated output. This is handily implemented in the
`estimate` method for the transcription objects. First we estimate
singing rate, effective detection distance, and density based on
truncated distance counts:

``` r
library(detect)
## Loading required package: Formula
## Loading required package: stats4
## Loading required package: pbapply
## detect 0.4-2      2018-08-29
cbind(true = c(phi=phi, tau=tau, D=Den), 
  estimate = estimate(x))
##     true  estimate
## phi  0.5 0.5768794
## tau  2.0 2.2733052
## D   10.0 8.2330714
```

Next we estimate singing rate, effective detection distance, and density
based on unlimited distance counts:

``` r
rint <- c(0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, Inf) # unlimited

(x <- bsims_transcribe(o, tint=tint, rint=rint))
## bSims transcript
##   1 km x 1 km
##   stratification: H
##   total abundance: 1014
##   duration: 10 min
##   detected: 259 heard
##   1st event detected by breaks:
##     [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 min]
##     [0, 50, 100, 150, 200, Inf m]
(y <- get_table(x, "removal")) # binned new individuals
##          0-1min 1-2min 2-3min 3-4min 4-5min
## 0-50m         1      3      1      2      0
## 50-100m       7      3      5      1      1
## 100-150m     12      2      2      1      2
## 150-200m     13      8      2      1      1
## 200+m        15      9      6      6      2
colSums(y)
## 0-1min 1-2min 2-3min 3-4min 4-5min 
##     48     25     16     11      6
rowSums(y)
##    0-50m  50-100m 100-150m 150-200m    200+m 
##        7       17       19       25       38

cbind(true = c(phi=phi, tau=tau, D=Den), 
  estimate = estimate(x))
##     true  estimate
## phi  0.5 0.5128359
## tau  2.0 1.9928785
## D   10.0 9.2041636
```

## Simulation workflow

Deviations from the assumptions and bias in density estimation can be
explored systematically by evaluating the simulations settings. We
recommend exploring the simulation settings interactively in the
**shiny** apps using `run_app("bsimsH")` app for the homogeneous
habitat case and the `run_app("bsimsHER")` app for the stratified
habitat case. The apps represent the simulation layers as tabs, the last
tab presenting the settings that can be copied onto the clipboard and
pasted into the R session or code. In simple situations, comparing
results from a few different settings might be enough.

Let us consider the following simple comparison: we want to see how much
of an effect does roads have when the only effect is that the road
stratum is unsuitable. Otherwise there are no behavioral or
detectability effects of the road.

``` r
tint <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
rint <- c(0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, Inf) # unlimited

## no road
b1 <- bsims_all(
  road = 0,
  density = c(1, 1, 0),
  tint = tint,
  rint = rint)
## road
b2 <- bsims_all(
  road = 0.5,
  density = c(1, 1, 0),
  tint = tint,
  rint = rint)
b1
## bSims wrapper object with settings:
##   road   : 0
##   density: 1, 1, 0
##   tint   : 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
##   rint   : 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, Inf
b2
## bSims wrapper object with settings:
##   road   : 0.5
##   density: 1, 1, 0
##   tint   : 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
##   rint   : 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, Inf
```

The `bsims_all` function accepts all the arguments we discussed before
for the simulation layers. Unspecified arguments will be taken to be the
default value. However, `bsims_all` does not evaluate these arguments,
but it creates a closure with the settings. Realizations can be drawn
as:

``` r
b1$new()
## bSims transcript
##   1 km x 1 km
##   stratification: H
##   total abundance: 75
##   duration: 10 min
##   detected: 12 heard
##   1st event detected by breaks:
##     [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 min]
##     [0, 50, 100, 150, 200, Inf m]
b2$new()
## bSims transcript
##   1 km x 1 km
##   stratification: HR
##   total abundance: 95
##   duration: 10 min
##   detected: 4 heard
##   1st event detected by breaks:
##     [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 min]
##     [0, 50, 100, 150, 200, Inf m]
```

Run multiple realizations is done as:

``` r
B <- 25  # number of runs
bb1 <- b1$replicate(B)
bb2 <- b2$replicate(B)
```

The replicate function takes an argument for the number of replicates
(`B`) and returns a list of transcript objects with \(B\) elements. The
`cl` argument can be used to parallelize the work, it can be a numeric
value on Unix/Linux/OSX, or a cluster object on any OS. The `recover =
TRUE` argument allows to run simulations with error catching.

Simulated objects returned by `bsims_all` will contain different
realizations and all the conditionally independent layers. Use a
customized layered approach if former layers are meant to be kept
identical across runs.

In more complex situations the **shiny** apps will help identifying
corner cases that are used to define a gradient of settings for single
or multiple simulation options. Let us consider the following scenario:
we would like to evaluate how the estimates are changing with increasing
road width. We will use the `expand_list` function which creates a list
from all combinations of the supplied inputs. Note that we need to wrap
vectors inside `list()` to avoid interpreting those as values to iterate
over.

``` r
s <- expand_list(
  road = c(0, 0.5, 1),
  density = list(c(1, 1, 0)),
  tint = list(tint),
  rint = list(rint))
str(s)
## List of 3
##  $ :List of 4
##   ..$ road   : num 0
##   ..$ density: num [1:3] 1 1 0
##   ..$ tint   : num [1:5] 2 4 6 8 10
##   ..$ rint   : num [1:5] 0.5 1 1.5 2 Inf
##  $ :List of 4
##   ..$ road   : num 0.5
##   ..$ density: num [1:3] 1 1 0
##   ..$ tint   : num [1:5] 2 4 6 8 10
##   ..$ rint   : num [1:5] 0.5 1 1.5 2 Inf
##  $ :List of 4
##   ..$ road   : num 1
##   ..$ density: num [1:3] 1 1 0
##   ..$ tint   : num [1:5] 2 4 6 8 10
##   ..$ rint   : num [1:5] 0.5 1 1.5 2 Inf
```

We now can use this list of settings to run simulations for each. The
following illustrates the use of multiple cores:

``` r
b <- lapply(s, bsims_all)
nc <- 4 # number of cores to use
library(parallel)
cl <- makeCluster(nc)
bb <- lapply(b, function(z) z$replicate(B, cl=cl))
stopCluster(cl)
```

In some cases, we want to evaluate crossed effects of multiple settings.
For example road width and spatial pattern (random vs. clustered):

``` r
s <- expand_list(
  road = c(0, 0.5),
  xy_fun = list(
    NULL,
    function(d) exp(-d^2/1^2) + 0.5*(1-exp(-d^2/4^2))),
  density = list(c(1, 1, 0)),
  tint = list(tint),
  rint = list(rint))
str(s)
## List of 4
##  $ :List of 5
##   ..$ road   : num 0
##   ..$ xy_fun : NULL
##   ..$ density: num [1:3] 1 1 0
##   ..$ tint   : num [1:5] 2 4 6 8 10
##   ..$ rint   : num [1:5] 0.5 1 1.5 2 Inf
##  $ :List of 5
##   ..$ road   : num 0.5
##   ..$ xy_fun : NULL
##   ..$ density: num [1:3] 1 1 0
##   ..$ tint   : num [1:5] 2 4 6 8 10
##   ..$ rint   : num [1:5] 0.5 1 1.5 2 Inf
##  $ :List of 5
##   ..$ road   : num 0
##   ..$ xy_fun :function (d)  
##   .. ..- attr(*, "srcref")= 'srcref' int [1:8] 5 5 5 53 5 53 5 5
##   .. .. ..- attr(*, "srcfile")=Classes 'srcfilecopy', 'srcfile' <environment: 0x7feb60723270> 
##   ..$ density: num [1:3] 1 1 0
##   ..$ tint   : num [1:5] 2 4 6 8 10
##   ..$ rint   : num [1:5] 0.5 1 1.5 2 Inf
##  $ :List of 5
##   ..$ road   : num 0.5
##   ..$ xy_fun :function (d)  
##   .. ..- attr(*, "srcref")= 'srcref' int [1:8] 5 5 5 53 5 53 5 5
##   .. .. ..- attr(*, "srcfile")=Classes 'srcfilecopy', 'srcfile' <environment: 0x7feb60723270> 
##   ..$ density: num [1:3] 1 1 0
##   ..$ tint   : num [1:5] 2 4 6 8 10
##   ..$ rint   : num [1:5] 0.5 1 1.5 2 Inf
```

The package considers simulations as independent in space and time. When
larger landscapes need to be simulated, there might be several options:
(1) simulate a larger extent and put multiple independent observers into
the landscape; or (2) simulate independent landscapes in isolation. The
latter approach can also address spatial and temporal heterogeneity in
density, behavior, etc. E.g. if singing rate is changing as a function
of time of day, one can define the `vocal_rate` values as a function of
time, and simulate independent animation layers. When the density varies
in space, one can simulate independent population layers.

## Next steps

The package currently is a snapshot of all that it can be. I am saying
this because it was written as an interactive tool for a workshop about
point count data analysis (see it the material
[here](https://peter.solymos.org/qpad-book/)). What it will become
largely depends on its user base and people willing to take it to the
next level via PRs with additional features ([see the code of
conduct](https://github.com/psolymos/bSims/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)).

If you have ideas, let me know in the
